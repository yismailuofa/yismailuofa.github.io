      Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:

      A strong believer is better and is more lovable to Allah than a weak believer, and there is good in everyone, (but) cherish that which gives you benefit (in the Hereafter) and seek help from Allah and do not lose heart, and if anything (in the form of trouble) comes to you, don't say: If I had not done that, it would not have happened so and so, but say: Allah did that what He had ordained to do and your" if" opens the (gate) for the Satan.

      Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), said: 

      When Allah created Paradise and Hellfire, He sent Gabriel to Paradise saying: Behold it and what I have prepared therein for its people. 

      Gabriel came and looked at it and what Allah had prepared therein for its people, then he returned to Allah and he said: By Your might, no one will hear of it but that he will enter it. 

      Allah ordered that it be surrounded by adversity and He said: Return to it and behold what I have prepared therein for its people. 

      Gabriel returned and found that it was surrounded by hardship, then he returned to Allah and he said: By Your might, I fear that no one will enter it. 

      Allah said: Go to the Hellfire and behold it and what I have prepared therein for its people. Gabriel found that it was in layers, one above another, then he returned to Allah and he said: By Your might, no one who hears of it will enter it. 

      Allah ordered that it be surrounded by desires and He said: Return to it. Gabriel returned and he said: By Your might, I fear that no one will escape it.
