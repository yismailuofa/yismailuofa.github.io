      Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:

      A strong believer is better and is more lovable to Allah than a weak believer, and there is good in everyone, (but) cherish that which gives you benefit (in the Hereafter) and seek help from Allah and do not lose heart, and if anything (in the form of trouble) comes to you, don't say: If I had not done that, it would not have happened so and so, but say: Allah did that what He had ordained to do and your" if" opens the (gate) for the Satan.

      your free time before your work, 
      and your life before your death.

      Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), said: 

      When Allah created Paradise and Hellfire, He sent Gabriel to Paradise saying: Behold it and what I have prepared therein for its people. 

      Gabriel came and looked at it and what Allah had prepared therein for its people, then he returned to Allah and he said: By Your might, no one will hear of it but that he will enter it. 

      Allah ordered that it be surrounded by adversity and He said: Return to it and behold what I have prepared therein for its people. 

      Gabriel returned and found that it was surrounded by hardship, then he returned to Allah and he said: By Your might, I fear that no one will enter it. 

      Allah said: Go to the Hellfire and behold it and what I have prepared therein for its people. Gabriel found that it was in layers, one above another, then he returned to Allah and he said: By Your might, no one who hears of it will enter it. 

      Allah ordered that it be surrounded by desires and He said: Return to it. Gabriel returned and he said: By Your might, I fear that no one will escape it.

      Know that the angel of death who has been assigned to you has not ceased to pass you and move on to others, ever since you have been in this world. But it is as if he is about to pass someone else and move on to target you, so be careful and prepare for him (by correcting your deeds). And do not forget him, for he does not forget you.

      Have you not considered how Allāh presents an example, [making] a good word like a good tree, whose root is firmly fixed and its branches [high] in the sky?

      It produces its fruit all the time, by permission of its Lord. And Allāh presents examples for the people that perhaps they will be reminded.

      Suhaib reported: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), said: 

      Strange are the ways of a believer for there is good in every affair of his and this is not the case with anyone else except in the case of a believer for if he has an occasion to feel delight, he thanks (God), thus there is a good for him in it, and if he gets into trouble and shows resignation (and endures it patiently), there is a good for him in it.

      Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), said: 

      The example of a believer is that of a fresh green plant the leaves of which move in whatever direction the wind forces them to move and when the wind becomes still, it stand straight. Such is the similitude of the believer: He is disturbed by calamities (but is like the fresh plant he regains his normal state soon). And the example of a disbeliever is that of a pine tree (which remains) hard and straight till Allah cuts it down when He will.

      Ibn 'Abbas reported: 

      I was behind the Prophet (ﷺ) one day when he said: 'O boy! I will teach you a statement: Be mindful of Allah and He will protect you. Be mindful of Allah and you will find Him before you. When you ask, ask Allah, and when you seek aid, seek Allah's aid. Know that if the entire creation were to gather together to do something to benefit you- you would never get any benefit except that Allah had written for you. And if they were to gather to do something to harm you- you would never be harmed except that Allah had written for you. The pens are lifted and the pages are dried.'

      Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded; and gain strength by worshipping in the mornings, the afternoons, and during the last hours of the nights.

      O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allāh is with the patient.
