title: "Why AR is the Next Big Platform"
---

Looking back in recent history, we can classify computing and software evolution into three distinct eras:

1. PC Era [^0]
   - The personal computer starts letting users interact with software in GUIs.
1. Internet Era
   - Browsers provide a lighter weight connection to a new interconnected world.
1. Mobile Era
   - Software becomes easily accessible, in a form factor small enough to carry in a pocket.

Analogously, each of these eras have a corresponding platform associated with them:

1. PC Era &rarr; Personal Computer
1. Internet Era &rarr; Web Browser
1. Mobile Era &rarr; Smartphone

The question is, were these eras ushered in by their platforms? Or were the platforms developed as a consequence of development during these eras?
