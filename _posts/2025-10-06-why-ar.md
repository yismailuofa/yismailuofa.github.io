title: "Why AR is the Next Big Platform"
---

Looking back in recent history, we can classify the evolution of computing and software into three distinct eras.
Each of these eras also has an associated platform that became the medium for the software of that time.

1. **PC Era** [^0] &rarr; Personal Computer
1. **Internet Era** &rarr; Web Browser
1. **Mobile Era** &rarr; Smartphone
1. **??? Era** &rarr; ???

An interesting observation is that a platform is not necessarily exclusive to an era, as evidenced by the fact that many people own laptops as well smartphones. And that smartphone and laptops can run internet browsers in addition to their own native applications. We begin to see this really come into play at companies like Apple, which through the MacBook, Safari, and iPhone have managed to provide a best in class offering to users at every platform.

With that being said, its not surprising to see Apple reporting
[$45 billion and $8 billion](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/fy2025-q3/FY25_Q3_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
in net sales for their iPhone and Mac products in Q3 2025 alone. Combine this with companies like Google paying them
[$18 billion](https://www.pcmag.com/news/google-pays-18-billion-per-year-to-be-the-default-search-engine-on-apple){:target="\_blank"}
to be the default search engine on Safari and you can quickly start realizing that controlling these platforms is a lucrative endeavour.

[^0]: Technically this should start at the Mainframe Era, but the technology wasn't really available to consumers yet.
