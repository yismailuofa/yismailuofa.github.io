title: "The Next Big Platform"
---

Looking back in recent history, we can classify the evolution of computing and software into three distinct eras.
Each of these eras also has an associated platform that became the medium for the software of that time.

1. **PC Era** [^0] &rarr; Personal Computer
1. **Internet Era** &rarr; Web Browser
1. **Mobile Era** &rarr; Smartphone

As the evolution of software continues, we can start to speculate on what the next era might be.

I believe the next era will be the **Augmented Reality (AR) Era**, with Smart Glasses as its medium.

## The First Adopter (Dis)advantage

Apple reported [$45 billion and $8 billion](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/fy2025-q3/FY25_Q3_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf){:target="\_blank"} in net sales for their iPhone and Mac products in Q3 2025 alone.

Combine this with companies like Google paying them [$18 billion](https://www.pcmag.com/news/google-pays-18-billion-per-year-to-be-the-default-search-engine-on-apple){:target="\_blank"} to be the default search engine on Safari and you can quickly start realizing that controlling these platforms is a financially rewarding endeavour.

Furthermore, this doesn't account for the switching costs once a user has adopted a product. Once someone has become accustomed to Apple's software, not only is switching to another offering more difficult, but they are even more incentivized to invest further into the ecosystem of products.

Clearly, many companies are racing to be the first to deliver a compelling AR experience and earn their share of customer loyalty before everyone else. However, we've seen many companies try (unsuccessfully) in the past years.

### 2014

Google launches _Google Glass_, a wearable set of eye frames with a projector display built in.

Despite being one of the first products to market, its unique design is quite jarring and the functionality leaves a lot to be desired.

### 2024

Apple debuts its first product in the AR space: the Apple Vision Pro.

Significant strides are made in _spatial computing_ yet a hefty price tag and bulky form factor lead to its

### 2025

Meta launches the _Meta Ray-Ban Display_, a successor to the widely successful _Meta Ray-Bans_, with two new features: An in lens projection display, and a neural wristband for controlling the interface.

This is the current state of the world so it is too early to tell but, initial reviews imply that despite a compelling technological feat of engineering, its price tag and feature set will be a limiting factor here.

## What Went Wrong

Looking at the past entries in this space, one might start doubting whether this will ever be adopted by consumers.

But if you look closely you might see some common themes emerge:

- **Prohibitive Price:** The cost of these smart glasses products have been more expensive than an everyday smartphone.

- **Limited Functionality:** Not only are they more expensive than a phone, but their feature set is far sparser making it far less appealing compared to another wearable like a smart watch.

- **Bad Aesthetics:** Since these products are designed to worn on a face, getting their look right is crucial. Unfortunately with the exception of Meta, past entries have prioritized function over fashion.

## Why AR Will Win

Luckily all of these problems are quite solvable as more investment comes into the field and designs improve.

### The Look

Following in Meta's footsteps I suspect many companies will adopt a more fashionable, sleeker eye glasses form factor. In fact we've already seen rumors of [Apple's entry in this category](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/04/apple-smart-glasses-launch-timeframe/){:target="\_blank"} slated for release in 2027.

### The Technology

Smart glasses tech has also made leaps and bounds over the years as chips are able to run more efficiently and in a smaller form factor. This means that the clunky designs of today will be shaved and shrunk to the sleek designs of tomorrow.

With initiatives like ARM processors we've also seen hardware design get better and more efficient over time.

### The Interface

Today's current software interfaces and functionality are still being iterated upon. While this might mean that users are interacting imperfect ideas, it also means that quality of the software and its capabilities will also improve as more developers join the ecosystem.

### The AI Wave

With the rise of Large Language Models and AI assistants, the ability to delegate tasks to a personal assistant has become commonplace. In a glasses form factor talking hands free to an assistant and getting information without lifting a fair is extremely compelling.

We've also seen models gain the ability to also understand images and video which paired with the camera feeds already present in AR wearables allows them to help you navigate or understand the world around you.

### The Compound Effect

An interesting observation from past eras is that a platform is not necessarily exclusive to an era, as evidenced by the fact that many people own laptops as well smartphones. And that smartphone and laptops can run internet browsers in addition to their own native applications.

This means that smart glasses would live alongside a phone, not become a replacement for one.

Additionally these devices would still be able to run a browser or other mobile applications allowing companies to extend their current offerings to users in a familiar way.
