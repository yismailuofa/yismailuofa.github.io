title: "The Next Big Platform"
---

Looking back in recent history, we can classify the evolution of computing and software into three distinct eras.
Each of these eras also has an associated platform that became the medium for the software of that time.

1. **PC Era** [^0] &rarr; Personal Computer
1. **Internet Era** &rarr; Web Browser
1. **Mobile Era** &rarr; Smartphone
1. **??? Era** &rarr; ???

An interesting observation is that a platform is not necessarily exclusive to an era, as evidenced by the fact that many people own laptops as well smartphones. And that smartphone and laptops can run internet browsers in addition to their own native applications. This overlapping effects really shines at companies like Apple, which through the MacBook, Safari, and iPhone have managed to provide a best in class offering to users at every platform.

With that being said, its not surprising to see Apple reporting
[$45 billion and $8 billion](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/fy2025-q3/FY25_Q3_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
in net sales for their iPhone and Mac products in Q3 2025 alone. Combine this with companies like Google paying them
[$18 billion](https://www.pcmag.com/news/google-pays-18-billion-per-year-to-be-the-default-search-engine-on-apple){:target="\_blank"}
to be the default search engine on Safari and you can quickly start realizing that controlling these platforms is a lucrative endeavour.

## The First Adopter Advantage

Clearly, many companies are racing to be the first to deliver a compelling Augmented Reality (AR) experience and earn their customer loyalty before everyone elses. However this is much easier said than done.

In February 2024 Apple debuted its first product in the AR space: the Apple Vision Pro.

Despite the significant strides made in _spatial computing_ its hefty price tag and bulky form factor lead to its

among consumers.
