title: "Why AR is the Next Big Platform"
---

Looking back in recent history, we can classify computing and software evolution into three distinct eras.

1. PC Era [^0]
   - The personal computer starts letting users interact with software in GUIs.
1. Internet Era
   - Browsers provide a lighter weight connection to a new interconnected world.
1. Mobile Era
   - Software becomes easily acessible, in a form factor small enought to carry in a pocket.

Analagously, each of these eras has a corresponding platform associated with it.

1. PC Era &rarr; Personal Computer
1. Intenet Era &rarr; Web Browser
1. Mobile Era &rarr; Smartphone

The question is, were the eras ushered in by these platforms? Or where the platforms developed as a consquence of development during these eras.
