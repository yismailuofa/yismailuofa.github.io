    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      I recently got into the beta for Google's new AI tool,
      <a href="https://illuminate.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">Illuminate</a
      >. It's a tool that takes a paper (currently only supports arXiv) and
      turns it into an 5-ish minute audio file in the style of a podcast. Now I
      wouldn't consider myself an avid paper reader, but I do enjoy listening to
      podcasts. So I thought I'd give it a try.

    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>
      The home page already has a moderate selection of pre-generated podcasts
      mostly comprised of papers on machine learning and AI with a few books
      like The Great Gatsby and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nonetheless, I wanted to try my own selections out, which you can do
      through the <i>Generate</i> tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generating is a pretty simple process, you give Illuminate your PDF's url,
      and after a couple of minutes, your audio file is ready. Additionally, you
      get 5 submissions a day which was fine for me just trying it out.
    </p>

    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
    <h5>Audio Style</h5>
    <p>
      I really enjoyed the podcast style Google chose for these summaries. The
      way the two hosts go back and forth and explain concepts to each other is
      quite engaging. It almost feels as if you are the one being explained to
      and this property is also part of the reason why I enjoy listening to
      (human) podcasts so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there are sometimes weird pauses, pronunciations (like Cplus in
      Paper 1), and vocal inflections that are a bit off. But I think these are
      minor issues that don't really impact the listening experience or detract
      from the content.
    </p>
    <h5>Content</h5>
    <p>
      The content of the summaries was pretty good and I felt they covered the
      main points of the papers while trying to explain them in a way that was
      easy to understand. This would probably be great tool for people who want
      to stay up to date with the latest research but don't have the time to
      read papers daily. In this way it feels reminiscent of products like
      Headway and Blinkist, but on demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the summaries are quite high level and don't go into quite as much
      detail as the papers themselves. This is to be expected given the time
      constraints, but I think it would be nice to have a bit more depth in the
      summaries.
    </p>
    <h5>User Experience</h5>
    <p>
      Generating the audio is pretty straightforward so no complaints there. My
      main feedback here would be that I wish you could upload your own PDFs
      instead of having to provide an arXiv link. Not all the papers I read are
      on arXiv and limiting it to only papers means books, blog posts, etc.
      can't be summarized. I think this is a pretty simple thing to implement
      given they already have the examples of books on the home page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another element that would be nice to have control over is the length of
      the output. 5 minutes is quite short, especially for longer papers. I
      think having the ability to choose the length would allow for more
      detailed discussions; but I'm also not sure how this would work given
      context lengths and how they implemented the summarization.
    </p>
    <h5>Future Work</h5>
    <p>
      Seeing how natural the voices are makes me want this level of quality in
      interactions with current LLMs. I think it would be really cool to have a
      conversational AI that could explain any concept to you in a podcast
      style. Current LLMs seem to ramble on too much, or explain things in a way
      that's suited for text output, not a conversation. As the processing power
      and inference speed of these models increase, I think this is a very real
      possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, I think it would be cool to have a feature where you could ask
      questions about the paper and have the AI answer them. Maybe this could be
      text prompts which generate new audio files with the answer included. Or
      maybe it could be a live chat feature where you can ask questions and hear
      them live. Regardless of the means, this would make it far better as a
      learning tool rather than an afternoon pastime.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, I think this tool is a really cool beta and I'm excited to see if
      Google takes it further.
